"Why would a fucking Zameendar become an alcoholic because a whore left him?"

"Paro wasn't a whore."

"All exes are whores."

Avash chuckles

"He was a rich bengali zamendaar at a time when men like him could build 
their own harems and he turns  into a drunk because of a bad breakup?
I don't buy it."

"But he loved paro. He couldn't just have someone else and be happy"

"Dev was happiest once he became a drunk because then he could induldge 
his ego hiding it in the veneer of heartbreak."

"No, he turned to drinking because he was in so much pain after Paro got married
because he loved her so much."

"No, Devdas only loved himself."

"Dude the whole story is about loving the other person! 
Two lovers whose lives are destroyed because they couldn't be together for life. 
They loved each other so much that without the other - they smiply couldn't
be happy enough to live."

"I think Dev would've died a drunk even if they were together."

"What. How?"

"The deadliest poison that eats at a man's heart. Jealousy."

"What do you mean?"

"Imagine they got married, and are together. I think at one point Dev 
would start getting jealous for one reason or another. Knowing Dev, do
you think he'd try to sort things out calmly or lash out?"

"Defo lash out. He isn't the calm type."

"Now, Dev's jealous - he gets into a fight with Paro. She's angry and says
stupid things and goes to her "maike" or somewhere else.
Angry, jealous, betrayed - where do you think Devdas will go?"

"Drinking?"

"Bingo. Drinking to drown his sorrows. To soothe his heart."

"Hmm maybe it's not such a crazy theory"

Binesh shrugs

"Not all men are Devdas though. There are kings who go to war and fight 
a demon to bring their wife back and stay together."

"and then ask her "You didn't sleep with him right? right?"

The evening rigns with their laughter and the wind blows.
