I'm reading [Word Power Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/Word-Power-Made-Easy-Vocabulary/dp/110187385X) and here's how it teaches to distinguish nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

## Nouns

A noun is a word which can be preceded by a, an, the, some, such or my. Eg: An egoist, Such asceticism, Some mysogynist.

## Verbs

A verb is a word which fits into the pattern: Let us _______. Eg: Let us eat, Let us talk, Let us philander.

## Adjective

An adjective is a word which fits into the pattern: You are very _______. Eg: You are very egocentric, You are very sinister, You are very gauche.

## Adverbs

Adverbs are formed by adding -ly to an adjective. Eg: sinisterly, educationally, egocentrically.
