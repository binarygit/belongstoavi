This is a play I wrote and performed for "Let's eat Chatpate" at Kausi theather.

## Banana - I love you
_Avi gets up on the stage with a banana in his hands_

I love eating bananas and I'm not sure what that means about me.
Some people love eating apples. Eating an apple is a methodical business.
You get an apple, wash it, cut it and eat it. I can't follow all these steps.

When I cut an apple, the pieces are too large, or there's no water on the tap or my house is on fire. I am not a collected enough person, a put together enough person who can go through all these steps. I have a friend who's a doctor - and he likes apples. He can get through these steps. That's talent.

Never in my life can I eat a pomogranate by myself. I don't have that patience. I'll never be a fucking teacher.

What I like is the banana. _peel the banana and look at it_
I don't know why I like it, but I do. I don't know what that means about me. I think a banana is a buddist fruit. It's a simple fruit, you peel it, you eat it and thank you all for coming to my zen performance.
