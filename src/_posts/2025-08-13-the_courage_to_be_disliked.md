## Notes

This is a theory, a story about how one can think about life. There are others theories out there too: Hinduism, Freudism etc.

There are two objectives for behaviour:
1. To become self reliant
2. To live in harmony with society.

Two objectives for psychology that supports these behaviours:
1. The conciousness that _I have the ability_
2. The conciousness that _people are my comrades_.

All problems are interpersonal relationship problems. When a person avoids having interpersonal relationships, he has problems. All behaviour can be explained by thinking about a person's motive behind behaving that way opposed to thinking that his past drives his behaviour. Eg: somebody is a shut in and avoids coming out. He might have had a bad experience in the past but the main reason he's a shut in is to avoid relationships, his goal could be to attract attention or to simply avoid getting hurt. Kids who cut wrists, take drugs are seeking attention through their behaviour.

An individual has certain life tasks that they need to tackle. Tackling these life tasks is what makes them self reliant. People who donot have the courage try and avoid life tasks or cope in an unhealthy way. They may also create an inferiority complex. Self acceptance is key in tackling life tasks. One must accept ones flaws and strengths and then act to remedy what's absent. This is only natural and human but when you avoid doing this, that is when problems arise.

An individual needs to have a 'sense of belonging' and a sense of 'contribution to others'. It is through a mixture of: striving towards self reliance, the feeling of being a part of a community and a 'feeling of contribution' to he community that a person becomes happy. However, the individual must have courage and he must not be afraid of being disliked.
